# Anamnesis contract (v3.1, 27 Oct 2026)

A pre-visit intake agent. It takes the patient's voice note (Voice Transcribe supports 25 languages; **tested live so far: English and Egyptian Arabic with code-switching**) and photos of their medicine packs, and gives the clinician a one-page brief. Every fact in the brief links to the audio turn and the image region it came from. **It reports where sources disagree. It never gives medical advice.** All data is synthetic.

## 1. Evidence (independent IDs, no forced chain)
| Model | Fields | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `AudioTurn` | `turn_id`, `start_ms`, `end_ms`, `transcript`, `speaker?`, `lang_hint?` | `end_ms > start_ms ≥ 0`. Turn-level timing only (Voice Transcribe has no word timestamps) |
| `ImageRegion` | `region_id`, `image_sha256`, `object_id`, `x1,y1,x2,y2`, `frame_w`, `frame_h`, `confidence?` | Source pixels, inclusive corners (SAM 3.1 format). `0 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 < frame_w`, same for y. `confidence` in [0,1]. Hash is 64 lowercase hex chars |

## 2. Medication facts
| Model | Fields | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `IngredientAmount` | `inn`, `salt?`, `amount`, `unit` | `amount > 0` (Decimal). `unit` ∈ `mg, mcg, g, ml, iu`. `inn` holds the **active moiety**: a curated alias table splits salt names (`"Metoprolol succinate"` → `inn="metoprolol"`, `salt="succinate"`). Synonyms are handled the same way (acetaminophen → paracetamol). An unknown suffix is never stripped |
| `Strength` | `ingredients: list[IngredientAmount]`, `per`, `release` | ≥1 ingredient (combinations: Augmentin 875/125) and **no duplicate canonical INNs**. `per` ∈ `tablet, capsule, ml, dose`. `release` ∈ `immediate, modified, unknown` (default `unknown`) |
| `DoseRegimen` | `units_per_intake?`, `intakes_per_day?`, `as_needed?` | Decimals > 0 when present (0.5 means half a tablet). `as_needed` defaults to `None`: unknown, not "no" |
| `PatientClaim` (from audio) | `claim_id`, `name_text`, `inn?`, `strength?`, `intake_amount?`, `regimen?`, `status`, `audio_evidence` | `audio_evidence` has ≥1 turn_id. `status` ∈ `active, discontinued, unknown`. `intake_amount` (what they take per intake) is kept separate from `strength` (what the tablet contains) |
| `PackObservation` (from image) | `observation_id`, `label_text?`, `inn?`, `strength?`, `readability`, `country?`, `visual_evidence` | `visual_evidence` has ≥1 region_id. `readability` ∈ `readable, partial, unreadable`. `readable` requires `label_text` |

`AudioTurn.transcript` and `speaker` are non-empty when present.

## 3. Findings (closed enum, lowercase)
| `DiscrepancyType` | Needs both sides | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `match` | yes | Same identity, and every comparison that could be made agreed |
| `strength_mismatch` | yes | Stated strength ≠ pack strength, or an intake that the pack can't give |
| `intake_differs_from_unit_strength` | yes | Intake is 0.5× (only for a tablet the catalogue marks splittable), 2×, 3× or 4× the unit strength. Possibly fine: ask |
| `ingredient_mismatch` | yes | Different canonical INN sets (Panadol vs Panadol Extra with caffeine) |
| `ratio_mismatch` | yes | Same combination, different ratio (Augmentin 875/125 vs 500/125) |
| `formulation_mismatch` | yes | Both release forms are known and differ (immediate vs modified) |
| `insufficient_information` | yes | Names agree, but the evidence can't confirm a match: no comparable amounts, release unknown against modified, unknown splittability, liquids, or contradictory extraction |
| `discontinued_but_present` | yes | Patient says they stopped; the pack is in the photo |
| `unreadable_source` | visual required | Label is unreadable or partial: abstain, never guess from shape or colour |
| `unresolved_name` | at least one side | Name not found in the catalogue, or the text names 2+ products |
| `missing_modality` | exactly one side | Only audio or only image evidence exists |

`Finding`: `finding_id`, `type`, `claim_id?`, `observation_id?`, `audio_evidence`, `visual_evidence`, `needs_clinician_review`, `clinician_note`, `patient_question_id?`.
- Every type except `match` requires `needs_clinician_review = true`.
- `claim_id` is set exactly when `audio_evidence` is non-empty, and `observation_id` exactly when `visual_evidence` is non-empty.
- **Text is enforced, not just advised:** `clinician_note` must equal `TEMPLATES[type]`, and `patient_question_id` must equal `QUESTION_FOR[type]`. Both tables live in `anamnesis/schema/templates.py`. The blocklist (`assert_no_advice`) is a regression check, not the safety boundary.

### Identity of one side
- Every ingredient field uses one resolver: a known catalogue moiety is canonicalised with `canonical_inn`; otherwise a name resolving to a single-INN catalogue entry resolves to that INN; otherwise the canonicalised input stays unchanged (unknown names remain unknown).
- **Identity set:** the resolved INNs of `strength.ingredients` if a strength exists. Otherwise the resolved scalar `{inn}`, otherwise the INNs of the catalogue entry that `name_text` (or `label_text`) resolves to.
- If a side has a strength and a resolvable name, or (when strength is absent) a scalar `inn` and a resolvable name, and their INN sets differ, that is an extraction conflict and the result is `insufficient_information`.
- When a side has both a strength and a scalar `inn`, the `inn`'s resolved moiety must be in the strength's ingredient set, otherwise it is an extraction conflict. A salt form of the same moiety is not.
- **Brand-implied facts** (`release`, `splittable`) come from the catalogue only when the text matched a **brand** name, never an INN. "Beloc-Zok" implies modified release; "metoprolol" implies nothing.

### Decision order for one claim and one pack (`reconcile_pair`)
The first rule that applies wins.
1. Pack `partial` or `unreadable` → `unreadable_source`.
2. Either identity set can't be built → `unresolved_name`.
3. Extraction conflict on either side → `insufficient_information`. This includes one side naming two different salts of the same ingredient (checked here, before any cross-side comparison, even if the other side names no salt).
4. The identity sets differ → `ingredient_mismatch`.
5. The claim's status is `discontinued` → `discontinued_but_present`.
6. **Known formulation conflicts:** named salts for the same canonical ingredient differ, or both release forms (explicit, otherwise brand-implied) are known and differ → `formulation_mismatch`. Salts for each side come from one shared path: strength ingredients, `intake_amount` (claim only), `salt_of(inn)` and whole-word curated salt aliases found in `name_text` / `label_text` after `catalogue.normalise` (a longer alias suppresses a shorter one it contains).
7. Both sides have a strength: compare amounts in mg (g ×1000, mcg ×0.001; `ml` and `iu` only against the same unit). When the claim names no salt, curated pack salt-basis equivalents compare against the nominal amount for both strength and intake. A stated tablet strength is exact: it matches the literal pack amount or the nominal amount, never a multiple or fraction of either; only intakes use the 0.5, 2, 3 and 4 dose ratios. Formulation checks still apply first. Unequal → `strength_mismatch` or `ratio_mismatch`.
8. The claim has an `intake_amount` and the pack strength has more than one ingredient → `insufficient_information` (a single amount can't be checked against a combination; strength-only combination claims still compare under rule 7). Otherwise, when the claim has an `intake_amount` (also when 7 found equal strengths): compare its INN, resolved by the same ingredient resolver, with a single-ingredient pack strength; a mismatch → `insufficient_information`.
   - `per` ∉ {tablet, capsule} → `insufficient_information`.
   - Compute r = intake / unit strength. r = 1 → continue.
   - r ∈ {2, 3, 4} → `intake_differs_from_unit_strength`.
   - r = 0.5 on a tablet. Splittability is per product, because some scored ER tablets such as Beloc-Zok may be halved: `splittable: true` → `intake_differs_from_unit_strength`; `false`, or a capsule → `strength_mismatch`; unknown → `insufficient_information`.
   - Otherwise → `strength_mismatch`.
9. No amount comparison was possible on either rule 7 or rule 8 → `insufficient_information`.
10. One release is `modified` and the other is `unknown` → `insufficient_information`.
11. Otherwise → `match`.

### Pairing (`reconcile_all`)
- Only readable packs can pair. Candidate pairs have overlapping identity sets.
- Score each candidate: 3 = same identity and equal strength, 2 = same identity, 1 = overlap.
- Take candidates greedily by score, then `claim_id`, then `observation_id`. Ties are broken by **ID**, not by list position, so the set of findings doesn't depend on the order of claims or packs. Findings come back sorted by `finding_id`.
- Leftovers:
  - an unreadable pack → `unreadable_source`
  - an unresolvable name → `unresolved_name`
  - otherwise → `missing_modality`

### Catalogue resolution
- `-` and `/` count as spaces and matching is on whole words. Each match records its character span; a match is suppressed only when its span is contained inside a longer match's span. Brand matches also cover INN or alias matches whose INN sets are within the brand's INNs. Text that names 2+ different brands or products → `None`; INN/alias-only matches sharing one INN set resolve deterministically by brand name.
- Arabic names remove diacritics and tatweel, normalize alef/ya/ta marbuta and Arabic-Indic digits, split Arabic/Latin boundaries, and accept the attached clitics `ال`, `وال`, `بال`, `فال`, `لل`, `و`, `ف`, `ب` and `ل`; curated Arabic brand aliases retain the brand's release and splittability.
- The country is a preference, never a filter: candidate entries sort country-match first (case-insensitive), then by brand, so the result is deterministic.
- Entries carry `release` and `splittable` (`true`, `false` or `null`). All entries are synthetic.

## 4. Agent loop (`anamnesis/agent/`, batches 14 and 15.5)
`run_intake(audio, images, ...)` runs a **fixed order**; no model chooses actions, nothing a model wrote is surfaced except source data (transcripts, label text), and there are no outer retries (adapters retry once themselves).
0. **Prepare** every photo before any model sees it (`prepare_image(data, mime) -> (data, mime)`, `anamnesis/agent/media.py`). Phones store the pixels sideways and record the turn in EXIF; SAM applies it and Spark does not (live, 27 Oct: on a portrait photo, 2 of 3 labels were read from the wrong pack). Preparation turns the pixels upright for every EXIF orientation (1–8) and drops all metadata (EXIF, including GPS and camera tags, and XMP), so SAM, Spark, the crop and the brief see the same pixels and no location leaves the machine. A photo that is already upright and carries no metadata is returned byte for byte. Otherwise a JPEG is re-encoded as JPEG (quality 95, 4:4:4 chroma) and anything else as PNG. Preparation is deterministic and idempotent; region hashes and `intake_id` use the prepared bytes, and callers that show a photo (the brief) show the prepared bytes. Bytes that can't be decoded raise `ValueError`; the loop then logs one `segment` step `error: image cannot be decoded` with no call ids, sends that photo to no model, and goes on with the next.
1. `transcribe` if there is audio. 2. `extract_claims` if there are turns.
3. Per image, `segment` with each concept in order (`medicine box`, `label`), stopping at the first that returns a region.
4. `read` the `top_regions(k=3)` of each image. A region is read only if its `image_sha256` and frame size match the prepared photo; otherwise a `read` step `error: region does not match the photo` is logged and the region is skipped.
5. Each `unreadable` or `partial` reading gets **one** `zoom_read`: the source image is cropped with `crop_region` (padded by 5% of the box size on each side, i.e. 10% in total, rounded down and clamped to the frame; refused unless the sha256 and frame size match the region), and the reader is called with `cropped=True`. The new reading keeps the **source** `region_id`, so provenance stays in source pixels. SAM never runs on a crop. At most 2 reads per region (`max_grounding_iters = 2`).
6. `reconcile` with `reconcile_all`.
- **Budget:** every provider call, including failed ones, counts 1 against `max_provider_calls` (default 12). The call that would exceed it is skipped, a `budget_exhausted` step is logged (it is then the last step, whatever fails afterwards, including a crop), and every remaining provider call is skipped. Reconciliation still runs on what exists.
- **Errors:** a provider error becomes a step whose `outcome` is `error: <provider> <ExceptionName>` (no message text); the loop continues with the next item.
- **Report:** one `ReconciliationReport` (`anamnesis/schema/report.py`): turns, claims, regions, observations (`o0, o1, ...` in reading order, `visual_evidence=[region_id]`), findings, steps, `calls`, `spend_usd` (sum of `cost_usd + prior_cost_usd` over every returned trace) and a sha256 `intake_id` of the inputs. A validator rejects any evidence, claim or observation id that points nowhere.
- **Session caps:** `SessionGuard(parent, max_usd, max_calls)` wraps the ledger guard with a per-session dollar and call cap and still writes every charge to the parent.
- Voice, SAM, and Spark calls retry once on retryable errors and use a 30 s timeout.

## 5. Every model call logs
- **Ledger** (`evidence/spend/ledger.jsonl`): `call_id`, `model_id`, `cost_usd`, `time_utc`, `estimated` (+ `reason`). Lines from before batch 12 have no `estimated` field; all of them are real charges.
- **Trace** (saved with each live result in `evidence/live/<date>/*.json`): latency and tokens as listed below.
- Muse Code grill runs (the `muse` CLI) are billed by Meta **outside** our adapters, so they are not on the ledger (see `evidence/decisions.md`).

`model_id`, `latency_ms`, `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cost_usd` → `evidence/`. Hosted Meta models are the default. Open weights (Glimmer on Modal, Spark Open on Baseten) are for comparison only.
Billing-uncertain failures are recorded at the pre-call estimate. Rejected 4xx and
429 requests are not charged.

## 6. Build rules
- All models use `extra="forbid"`. No recursive JSON schemas.
- Tests pass offline, with no keys and no network.
- `tests/contract/` is written by the reviewer before each batch. A batch that edits it is rejected.
